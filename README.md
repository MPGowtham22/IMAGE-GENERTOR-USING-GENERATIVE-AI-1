# IMAGE-GENERTOR-USING-GENERATIVE-AI-1
Image generation using Generative AI involves creating new, synthetic images from scratch by learning patterns and features from a dataset of real images. This is achieved using various generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and diffusion models.
